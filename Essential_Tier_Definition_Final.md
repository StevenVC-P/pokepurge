## 🔁 Rotating League Clarification

Across all tiers (Essential, Valuable, Reliable, Useful):
- Only **major leagues** (Great, Ultra, Master) qualify for PvP relevance.
- PvP performance in limited cups, novelty formats, or seasonal leagues must be **extraordinary** to merit consideration.
- **Restricted-format dominance alone does not qualify** unless the Pokémon is also viable in a major league.

## 🔄 Redundancy Cleanup (Moveset Criteria)

In "Moveset Meta Alignment" (Essential and Valuable tiers), replace repeated phrasing:

> "Fast move with good energy generation and neutral coverage..."

With:

> "Optimized PvP movesets typically feature a fast move with solid energy gain and at least one charge move offering either strong bait pressure or high closing power."

These phrasings have been unified across all tiers where relevant.
