üß† Dynamax AI Evaluation Criteria
This document outlines the structured, question-driven framework used to generate consistent and insightful AI analysis for Dynamax Battles in Pok√©mon GO. The purpose is to guide AI systems to produce strategic, casual-friendly evaluations of a Pok√©mon‚Äôs viability when Dynamaxed.

Each evaluation should consider how well a Pok√©mon performs during Max Battle-specific mechanics, including:

Max Move performance across 3 turns

Fast attack value pre- and post-Dynamax

Role flexibility (Attacker, Tank, Healer, Lead)

Investment and accessibility value for casual players

These evaluations aim to help dedicated casual players make smart, efficient decisions about resource use and team building.

1. Typing and Max Move Matchups
What types does this Pok√©mon counter effectively when Dynamaxed?

Which Max Move types does it gain access to?

What relevant threats do those Max Moves help cover?

Does its typing provide key resistances or vulnerabilities during Max Battles?

Does it contribute STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) to Max Move output?

2. Moveset & Max Move Synergy
Do its fast and charge moves convert into strong Max Moves (damage, weather, stat boost, healing)?

Does it have:

A high-DPS charge move that becomes a powerful Max Move?

Access to support Max Moves like Max Spirit (heal) or Max Guard (tank)?

Max Moves that trigger teamwide effects (e.g., Max Ooze boosts allies)?

Is there a clear synergy between its base kit and Max Move function?

Are energy-efficient or fast-charging moves available to support early Dynamax?

Is the Max Move meaningfully stronger than what its fast attack already provides?

3. Evolutionary and Dynamax Value
In Dynamax battles (uncapped, non-league PvE), evolved forms are typically preferred unless proven otherwise.

Does this form offer Dynamax value over its evolved version?

Does evolving it unlock better Max Move synergy or higher stats?

Are there specific use cases where the base form is strategically better? (e.g. faster charge, early lead)

If not, is this form non-viable for Dynamax and only usable for charging or filler?

4. Relative Dynamax Performance
Compared to other Dynamax-eligible Pok√©mon, how competitive is this one?

Does it fill a clear niche (e.g., reliable healer, solo tank, Max Weather setter)?

Is it outclassed by another Max Pok√©mon in the same typing or role?

Does it scale well in small team or low-star Max Battles?

5. Stat Profile and Survivability
Can it survive all 3 turns of Dynamax consistently?

Does it have the bulk to tank boss hits or draw aggro safely?

Is it too frail or slow to contribute before fainting?

Can it efficiently dodge boss attacks (short animation, fast cooldowns)?

Does it reliably survive targeted boss aggression, especially when using Max Guard?

6. Tiered Boss Performance and Format Fit
In which Max Battle tiers (1-star to 6-star) is this Pok√©mon viable?

Is it better suited for:

Solo/small group formats?

Large coordinated teams?

Does it excel in event-restricted formats (e.g. special Max Mondays)?

Is it gated by legacy moves or unavailable Max Move unlocks?

Does it offer meaningful help when stationed at a Power Spot?

7. Max Battle Role & Team Fit
What is its ideal Max Battle role:

Max Attacker

Tank (Max Guard user)

Healer (Max Spirit user)

Support hybrid

Early Meter Lead (fast charging to trigger Dynamax)

Can it serve multiple roles depending on move choices?

Does it fit specific team archetypes or type coverage holes?

Can it function even off-Dynamax if another team member gets the boost?

Is it optimal for first in lineup vs. Dynamax finisher?

8. Form Variant Comparison (Shadow, Mega, Base)
How does this Dynamax form compare to:

Its Mega evolution

Shadow form

Base (non-Dynamax) form

Are there advantages (or disadvantages) in choosing Dynamax over Shadow/Mega?

Is the base form more viable in any specific Dynamax scenario?

9. Power-Up and Investment Justification
Is this Pok√©mon worth powering up specifically for Max Battles?

Does it justify:

Using Elite TMs?

Spending Max Particles to unlock extra Max Moves?

Investing Candy XL?

How many copies are recommended (1 generalist, 2+ role-specific)?

Is it usable across multiple Max Battle difficulties or only one niche?

10. Strategic Summary (Max Battle-Specific)
What is this Pok√©mon‚Äôs core strategy when Dynamaxed?

Suggested turn sequence (e.g., Guard ‚Üí Heal ‚Üí Attack?)

What are its key matchups, strengths, and vulnerabilities?

When should it be avoided or substituted?

What‚Äôs its team-friendly value in uncoordinated lobbies?

11. Turn-Based Max Move Strategy
Can it deliver three impactful actions during Dynamax?

Does it have the ability to:

Max Guard and survive

Max Spirit to heal at the right moment

Stack Max Move debuffs/buffs?

Does it need support teammates to work effectively?

Can it carry a phase solo if needed?

12. AI Output Guidance
AI systems generating Dynamax analysis should:

Prioritize clarity and practical advice over theory

Avoid jargon and explain terms like ‚ÄúMax Guard‚Äù and ‚ÄúAggro‚Äù simply

Frame advice for players who:

Want to invest smartly

Prefer common or accessible Pok√©mon

Are comfortable but not competitive players

Use strategic patterns like:

‚ÄúUse Max Guard Turn 1 to bait boss aggro.‚Äù

‚ÄúHeals team for 30‚Äì40% HP with Max Spirit ‚Äî best used after group-wide hits.‚Äù

‚ÄúAvoid using unless fully built (Level 40+, 3-star Max Attack).‚Äù

üìé Appendix: Evaluating Base vs. Evolved Forms
Factor	Base Form (e.g. Charmander)	Evolved Form (e.g. Charizard)
Default Expectation	Weak unless justified	Strong unless outclassed
Primary Use	Fast charge lead / filler	Damage / tank / support roles
Move Access	Often restricted	Broader pool, may include legacy/elite moves
Stat Profile	Fragile, lower HP and damage	Balanced for 3-turn Dynamax performance
Role Justification	Requires high synergy or unique behavior	Needs only average or better meta standing
Investment Value	Poor return long term	Strong long-term utility if viable
